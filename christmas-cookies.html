            </ul>

            <h3>To decorate</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>200g icing sugar, sieved                            </li>
                <li>edible food colouring, optional                     </li>
                <li>edible gold and silver balls                        </li>
                <li>approx 2m thin ribbon cut into 10 cm lengths        </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Tip the icing sugar, vanilla extract, egg yolk 
                    and butter into a mixing bowl, then stir together 
                    with a wooden spoon (or pulse in a food processor 
                    until well combined). Add the flour and mix to a 
                    firm dough. Shape the dough into two flat discs 
                    and wrap them. Chill for 20-30 mins. Heat oven to 
                    190C/fan 170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets 
                    with non-stick baking paper.                        </li>
                    <p></p>

                <li>Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to
                    about the thickness of two Â£1 coins. Cut out
                    Christmassy shapes (use a cutter if you like) and
                    place on the baking sheets. Using the tip of a
                    skewer, cut a small hole in the top of each
                    cookie. Bake for 10-12 mins until lightly golden.   </li>
                    <p></p>

                <li>Lift the biscuits onto a wire rack to cool. 
                    Meanwhile, mix the icing sugar with a few drops 
                    of cold water to make a thick, but still runny icing. 
                    Colour with edible food colouring, if you like. 
                    Spread it over the cooled biscuits, decorate with 
                    edible balls and thread with ribbon when dry.       </li>
            </ol>
