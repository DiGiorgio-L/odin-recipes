        </ul>

        <h3>For the glaze</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>150g marmalade                                  </li>
            <li>100g light brown soft sugar                     </li>
            <li>2 limes, juiced                                 </li>
            <li>2cm piece of ginger, peeled and grated  
                to a pur√©e                                      </li>
            <li>2 star anise, plus extra to use on the 
                joint                                           </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the gammon in a large pan and cover with
                cold water. Bring to the boil, then immediatly
                remove from the heat. Pour away the water and 
                any scum                                        </li>
                <p></p>
            <li>Add the cider and orange to the pan, followed
                by enough water to cover the ham, then add the 
                peppercorns, onion, bay, celery, carrots and 
                parsley. Bring slowly to the boil, the lower to 
                a gentle simmer, cover and cook gently for 1/2
                hrs, or until the meat is tender. Cool to room 
                temperature, then leave the meat in the liquid
                in the fridge for up to two days until you are 
                to bake it.                                     </li>
                <p></p>
            <li>Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Lift
                the ham onto a board and, using a small 
                sharp knife, remove the skin and string, 
                leaving as much fat as possible on the 
                joint. Score the fat in a criss-cross 
                pattern, without cutting through the meat. 
                Put the ham in a roasting tin lined with 
                a double layer of foil.                         </li>
                <p></p>
            <li>Heat the marmalade, sugar, lime juice, ginger
                and 2 star anise in a saucepan until the sugar
                and marmalade have melted. Leave to cool a 
                little so the glaze thickens.                   </li>
                <p></p>
            <li>Spread the glaze over the ham, then push star 
                anise into some of the diamonds and bake for 
                40 mins until glossy and caramelised in patches. 
                Baste the ham, spooning the glaze over it, a 
                couple of times during the cooking time. 
                Leave to cool slightly before slicing and 
                serving.                                        </li>
        </ol>
